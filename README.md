### Welcome!
You can call me Ryan or Mal.

- I've been programming since 2013 or 2014 when I took my first high-school classes (VB.NET and Java).
- I've been in the industry for 5+ years doing front-end, internal tooling, and devops. 
- I'm interested in back-end web dev, game (engine) dev, systems programming, and embedded development.
- I love learning about computing and programming history.
